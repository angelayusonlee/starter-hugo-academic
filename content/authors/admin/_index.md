I'm a 4th year PhD candidate in Communication at Stanford University, where I study media psychology in the Social Media Lab. My research focuses on optimizing experiences with social technology by empowering users to have *agency* over their digital lives. I am particularly interested in helping people leverage new technologies to improve their psychological well-being, obtain better insights into their mental health, and navigate information and misinformation more effectively at scale. 

To do so, I employ a variety of methods including qualitative interviews, survey research, lab and field experiments, and computational analysis of smartphone log data. Most importantly, I collaborate with community partners to develop interventions to real-world problems that threaten our personal and collective well-being. 

My research is supported by the Stanford Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship, the Haas Graduate Public Service Fellowship, and the Stanford Impact Labs Collaborative Research Fellowship. 

I'm always more than happy to talk more about research and life. Feel free to reach me at angela8@stanford.edu or @angelaylee374 on Twitter.
