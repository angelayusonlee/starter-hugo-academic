I'm a 4th year PhD candidate in Communication at Stanford University, where I study media psychology in the Social Media Lab. My research focuses on optimizing experiences with social technology by empowering users to have *agency* over their digital lives. I am particularly interested in helping people leverage new technologies to improve their psychological well-being, obtain better insights into their mental health, and navigate information and misinformation more effectively at scale. 

To do so, I collaborate with community partners to develop interventions to real-world problems that threaten our personal and collective well-being.
